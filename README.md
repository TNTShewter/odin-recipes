This is the README for the Odin Recipes project focusing solely on fundamental 
HTML skills. This project will test the knowledge I have of every HTML skill
I have learned so far by having me create a website with multiple pages 
describing recipes for food and how to make them.

The project requires me to create three seperate recipe pages that are navigated
to using the index page. All three recipe pages need to include an image of the 
finished recipe, a description of the recipe. an unordered list of ingredients 
needed, an ordered list that has the directions on how to actully make the food, 
as well as headings for each part of the page in order to format it all cohesively.
